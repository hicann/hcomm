After developing a communication operator, you need to deploy it to the operating environment for functional verification.

## Understanding the Custom Operator Build and Packaging Project

The HCCL code repository provides a custom operator build and packaging project. You can refer to the [custom Send/Receive communication operator example](https://gitcode.com/cann/hccl/tree/9.1.0/examples/04_custom_ops_p2p) for development. The directory structure is as follows:

        └── Makefile                         # Build configuration file
```

You are advised to organize code files based on the directory structure above. Pay attention to the following key points:

1. Place custom operator header files in the **inc** folder.
2. Place host-side implementation code in the **op_host** folder, and AI CPU-side implementation code in the **op_kernel_aicpu** folder.
3. Adjust the **CMakeLists.txt** file as needed.

## Building a Custom Operator Package

1. Set the CANN software environment variables.

    ```bash
    source /usr/local/Ascend/cann/set_env.sh
    ```

    **/usr/local/Ascend** is the default installation path of CANN for the root user. If you install CANN as a non-root user or in a custom path, replace it with the actual path.

2. Download the HCCL repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://gitcode.com/cann/hccl.git
    ```

3. Build the custom operator package.

    ```bash
    bash build.sh --vendor=<vendor> --ops=<ops> --custom_ops_path=<ops_project_path>
    ```

    Where:

    - <vendor\>: Custom operator package identifier, which is user-defined and must be unique.
    - <ops\>: Custom operator name, which is user-defined and must be unique.
    - <ops_project_path\>: Root directory of the custom operator project, for example, the ./examples/04_custom_ops_p2p directory in [Understanding the Custom Operator Build and Packaging Project](#understanding-the-custom-operator-build-and-packaging-project). It can be configured as an absolute or relative path.

    After the build is complete, a custom operator installation package cann-hccl_custom_<ops\>_linux-<arch\>.run is generated in the build_out directory of the current directory, where:

    - <ops\>: indicates the operator name specified by the --ops parameter when building the custom operator package.
    - <arch\>: indicates the system architecture of the current build environment.

## Deploying the Custom Operator Package

Run the following command to install the package:

```bash
./build_out/cann-hccl_custom_<ops>_linux-<arch>.run --install
```

The custom operator package installation information is as follows:

- Header file: ***$\{ASCEND_HOME_PATH\}*/opp/vendors/<vendor\>/include**
- Dynamic library: ***$\{ASCEND_HOME_PATH\}*/opp/vendors/<vendor\>/lib64**
- AI CPU operator information library file: ***$\{ASCEND_HOME_PATH\}*/opp/vendors/<vendor\>/aicpu/config**
- AI CPU operator package: ***$\{ASCEND_HOME_PATH\}*/opp/vendors/<vendor\>/aicpu/kernel**
- Installation script: ***$\{ASCEND_HOME_PATH\}*/opp/vendors/<vendor\>/scripts/install.sh**

Here, ***<vendor\>*** is the operator identifier specified by the **--vendor** parameter when compiling a custom operator package.
