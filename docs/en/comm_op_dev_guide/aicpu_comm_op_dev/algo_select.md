# Selecting Algorithms

<!-- md-trans-meta sourceCommit=4bce6591eb0a4898412343ee53a224437de00bfe translatedAt=2026-08-11T07:01:59.305Z pushedAt=2026-08-20T11:39:14.557Z -->

## Selection Policy

AI CPU communication operators should select a communication algorithm based on the actual physical topology. For example:

- For a single-server multi-device mesh topology, the Mesh algorithm is recommended to leverage direct inter-device links for parallel communication.
- For a topology with multiple servers and a single device per server, the NHR algorithm is recommended for communication along cross-server links.

The following figure shows the AI CPU communication algorithm selection schematic diagram.

> [!NOTE] Note
>
> 1. Algorithm selection should be based on the actual physical topology queried from the runtime environment, rather than determining the topology solely by the number of ranks.
> 2. If a custom operator supports only one physical topology and one algorithm implementation, you can skip the algorithm selection step and directly use that algorithm.

## Sample Code

```c
CommEngine engine;
if (engine == CommEngine::COMM_ENGINE_AICPU_TS) {
    algName = "AicpuMesh";  // Select the Mesh algorithm implemented by AI CPU.
} else {
    return HCCL_E_NOT_SUPPORT;
}
```
