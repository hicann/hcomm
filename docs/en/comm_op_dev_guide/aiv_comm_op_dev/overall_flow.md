The development process of HCCL communication operators is as follows:

1. **Define the operator API**: Define the communication operator API based on the function of the communication operator.
2. **Query topology information**: Obtain information such as the network hierarchy and number of nodes in the communicator.
3. **(Optional) Select algorithms**: To maximize communication performance, different algorithms are often used for different topologies and data sizes. Therefore, select the optimal communication algorithm based on topology information.
4. **Create resources**: Allocate the memory, thread, Notify, channel, and other resources required by the communication algorithm.
5. **Schedule tasks**: Use communication resources to coordinate each rank for synchronization and data movement, completing the collective communication operation.
6. **Dispatch the operator**: Dispatch the operator kernel to the communication engine for execution.
