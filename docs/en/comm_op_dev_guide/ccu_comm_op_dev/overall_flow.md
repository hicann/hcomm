The development process of HCCL communication operators is as follows:

![](figures/ccu_dev_flow.png)

1. **Define the operator API**: Define the communication operator API based on its functionality.
2. **Query topology information**: Obtain information such as the network hierarchy and number of nodes in the communicator.
3. **(Optional) Selecting algorithms**: To maximize communication performance, different algorithms are often used for different topologies and data sizes. Therefore, the optimal communication algorithm needs to be selected based on topology information.
4. **Create resources**: Allocate resources such as memory, threads, Notify, and channels required by the communication algorithm, and complete CCU kernel registration and resource allocation.
5. **Dispatch the operator**: Dispatch the operator kernel to the communication engine for execution.
6. **Execute the algorithms**: Use communication resources to synchronize and transfer data between each rank through the CCU, completing the collective communication operation.
