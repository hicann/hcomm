## Description

Writes data to the specified memory on the channel. The memory data of length len in src is written to the memory area of the same length pointed to by dst, and a synchronization signal is sent to the node where dst resides. The API caller is the node where src resides. This API is non-blocking.

## Function Prototype

```c
int32_t HcommWriteWithNotifyNbi(ChannelHandle channel, void *dst, const void *src, uint64_t len,
    uint32_t remoteNotifyIdx)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Input/Output | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| channel | Input | Communication channel handle, which is the channels obtained through the [HcclChannelAcquire](../../../control_plane_api/comms_domain_resource_mgmt/HcclChannelAcquire.md) API. For constraints on channel, see Constraints.<br>For the definition of the ChannelHandle type, see [ChannelHandle](../../../datatype_definition/ChannelHandle.md). |
| dst | Output | Destination memory address, which is the remote memory address obtained through [HcclGetHcclBuffer](../../../control_plane_api/comms_domain_resource_mgmt/HcclGetHcclBuffer.md) or [HcclChannelGetHcclBuffer](../../../control_plane_api/comms_domain_resource_mgmt/HcclChannelGetHcclBuffer.md). |
| src | Input | Source memory address, which is the local memory address obtained through [HcclGetHcclBuffer](../../../control_plane_api/comms_domain_resource_mgmt/HcclGetHcclBuffer.md) or [HcclChannelGetHcclBuffer](../../../control_plane_api/comms_domain_resource_mgmt/HcclChannelGetHcclBuffer.md). |
| len | Input | Data length (in bytes), which must be greater than 0. |
| remoteNotifyIdx | Input | Notify index of the other end of the communication channel.<br>Value range: [0, notifyNum).<br>notifyNum is the notifyNum in the channelDesc parameter passed to the [HcommChannelCreate](../../../control_plane_api/basic_resource_mgmt/HcommChannelCreate.md) or [HcclChannelAcquire](../../../control_plane_api/comms_domain_resource_mgmt/HcclChannelAcquire.md) API. |

## Return Value

int32_t: This API returns 0 on success an a non-zero value on failure.

## Constraints

<!-- npu="950" id6 -->
- For Ascend 950PR/Ascend 950DT, this API can be called only on the host CPU, and cannot be called on the AI CPU side.
- When calling [HcclChannelAcquire](../../../control_plane_api/comms_domain_resource_mgmt/HcclChannelAcquire.md) to allocate the input parameter `channel`, pass `engine = COMM_ENGINE_CPU` and set `channelDesc.remoteEndpoint.protocol = COMM_PROTOCOL_ROCE`. Protocol channels such as URMA and UBC do not support this API currently.
<!-- end id6 -->
- `[src, src + len)` must fall within the memory range registered or obtained on the local end, and `[dst, dst + len)` must fall within the memory range imported or obtained on the remote end.
- `remoteNotifyIdx` must be smaller than the number of Notify resources on the other end of the communication channel, and `notifyNum` must be greater than 0 when the communication channel is created.
- The write target end should call [HcommChannelNotifyWait](HcommChannelNotifyWait.md) to wait for the synchronization signal.
- A successful return from this API only indicates that the write-with-notification request has been submitted successfully. To confirm that the submitted write operations on the local channel have completed, call [HcommChannelFence](HcommChannelFence.md).

## Example

```c
// Omitted: Create the communicator handle comm.

// Allocate communication channel resources.
CommEngine engine = CommEngine::COMM_ENGINE_CPU;
uint32_t channelNum = 1;
HcclChannelDesc channelDesc;
HcclResult result = HcclChannelDescInit(&channelDesc, channelNum);
channelDesc.channelProtocol = COMM_PROTOCOL_ROCE;
channelDesc.localEndpoint.protocol = COMM_PROTOCOL_ROCE;
channelDesc.remoteEndpoint.protocol = COMM_PROTOCOL_ROCE;
channelDesc.notifyNum = 1;
// Omitted: Fill in other information in channelDesc.
ChannelHandle channel;
result = HcclChannelAcquire(comm, engine, &channelDesc, channelNum, &channel);

// Obtain the local communication memory information.
void * localBuffer;
uint64_t localBufferSize;
result = HcclGetHcclBuffer(comm, &localBuffer, &localBufferSize);

// Obtain the remote communication memory information.
void * remoteBuffer;
uint64_t remoteBufferSize;
result = HcclChannelGetHcclBuffer(comm, channel, &remoteBuffer, &remoteBufferSize);
uint64_t len = std::min(localBufferSize, remoteBufferSize);

// Write the content of the local memory to the peer memory and notify the remote end.
uint32_t rmtNotifyIdx = 0;
int32_t ret = HcommWriteWithNotifyNbi(channel, remoteBuffer, localBuffer, len, rmtNotifyIdx);

// Wait for the submitted write operations on the communication channel to complete.
ret = HcommChannelFence(channel);
```

The following code is called on the write destination side to wait for the synchronization signal sent by the write initiator.

```c
// Omitted: resource creation

// Use the local Notify index to wait for the synchronization signal sent by the write initiator.
uint32_t lclNotifyIdx = 0;
uint32_t notifyTimeout = 1800;
int32_t ret = HcommChannelNotifyWait(channel, lclNotifyIdx, notifyTimeout);
```
