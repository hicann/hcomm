## Description

`ccu::LocalAddr` is a C++ wrapper class for the local on-chip memory address within a CCU kernel. It is a composite object of "address (`Address`) + token (`Variable`)".

- Allocation on construction: the default constructor allocates one `Address` (for `addr`) and one `Variable` (for `token`) at a time.
- No release on destruction: the destructor does not release hardware resources. The virtual handle becomes invalid after translation is complete, and the physical resources are managed and reclaimed uniformly over the CCU instance lifecycle.

CCU hardware does not accept process virtual addresses. To access on-chip memory, you must use the token converted by `HcommCcuGetMemToken` (called on the host side). The `addr` field of `LocalAddr` stores the physical address (or the tokenized VA), and the `token` field stores the matching security token value.

## Class Declaration

```cpp
namespace AscendC {
namespace ccu {
class LocalAddr final {
public:
    LocalAddr();                         // Allocation upon construction (allocate both Address and Variable).
    Address addr;                        // Local on-chip memory address field (Address object).
    Variable token;                      // Security token field (Variable object).
    CcuLocalAddrHandle handle{0};       // Composite handle.
};
} // namespace ccu
} // namespace AscendC
```

## Constructor Description

| Construction Form | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `LocalAddr la;` | Allocates one `Address` and one `Variable` virtual handle at a time, and fills in the three handles `la.handle`/`la.addr.handle`/`la.token.handle`. |

The C++ constructor only allocates virtual handles: when called during the kernel registration phase, it always succeeds; if it is not called during the kernel registration phase, an exception is thrown at construction time (carrying the error code `CCU_E_PTR`). When the physical resources of `Address`/`Variable` are insufficient, `CCU_E_UNAVAIL` is returned during the `HcommCcuKernelRegister` phase, rather than being thrown at construction time.

> [!CAUTION] Caution
> The `LocalAddr` class has copy/move constructors, which only copy the three fields `handle` / `addr.handle` / `token.handle` and do not allocate new `Address`/`Variable` objects. After `LocalAddr l2 = l1;`, `l1` and `l2` point to the same group of `Address`/`Variable` objects. However, `operator=(const LocalAddr& other)` (assignment, not construction) is not a handle copy: it executes `this->addr = other.addr; this->token = other.token;`, that is, it delivers two device-side assignment instructions (see `Address::operator=` / `Variable::operator=`), performing a value transfer between two independent groups of `Address`/`Variable` objects. The two semantics are asymmetric, so pay special attention when using them.

## Field Description

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `addr` | `Address` | Local on-chip memory address. Assign a value through `la.addr = imm` (immediate value) or `la.addr = var` (Variable). For operator semantics, see [Address](Address.md). |
| `token` | `Variable` | Security token value. After the host obtains it by calling `HcommCcuGetMemToken`, pass it into the kernel through `kernelArg` or `taskArgs`+`LoadArg`, and then assign it to `la.token`. For operator semantics, see [Variable](Variable.md). |

## Constraints

> [!CAUTION] Caution
> `token` is security information. It must not be printed in host or device logs, and must not be passed across ranks in plaintext.

- LocalAddr can be constructed only during the kernel registration phase.
- The destructor does not release hardware resources. Do not save or compare the `handle` value outside the kernel. The handle becomes invalid after the translation is complete.
- Do not separately call `Address()`/`Variable()` on the embedded `addr`/`token` fields to construct new objects — `LocalAddr()` has already completed the allocation of all subfields at once.
- The `addr` field must be assigned a physical address accessible to the CCU or a tokenized VA. Passing a process virtual address that has not been tokenized directly will trigger a driver error.
- The `token` usually comes from the `HcommCcuGetMemToken` call on the host side, and must be paired with `addr`. It must not be mixed with the peer token.

## Example

```cpp
using namespace AscendC::ccu;

// Host side (before kernel registration):
// uint64_t tokenInfo = 0;
// HcommCcuGetMemToken(srcVa, size, &tokenInfo);
// kernelArg.srcAddr = srcVa;
// kernelArg.srcToken = tokenInfo;

CcuResult MyKernel(CcuKernelArg arg) {
    auto* params = static_cast<MyKernelArg*>(arg);

    LocalAddr src;
    // Assign from the kernelArg in the registration phase (fixed as an immediate value).
    src.addr = params->srcAddr;
    src.token = params->srcToken;

    // Or inject it at runtime through taskArgs (more flexible).
    Variable addrVar, tokenVar;
    LoadArg(addrVar, 0);    // taskArgs[0] = address
    LoadArg(tokenVar, 1);   // taskArgs[1] = token
    LocalAddr src2;
    src2.addr = addrVar;    // Runtime dynamic address
    src2.token = tokenVar;

    return CCU_SUCCESS;
}
```
